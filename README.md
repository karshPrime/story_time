# Story Time bot

Discord channels where users type random words to complete one other's sentence is a fun way to keep the community engaged; however, it becomes quite annoying to scroll to the very top to and read the developed story from the start.

Add this to your server and configure it with your story channel, and with /storysofar or /ssf users would be able to sum up the entire story in one message and read it with ease.
